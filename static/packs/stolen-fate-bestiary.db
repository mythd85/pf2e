After long years of research and the creation of a special container called a phylactery, a spellcaster takes the final step by imbibing a deadly concoction or casting dreadful incantations that transform them into a lich. While most undertake this drastic plan to continue their work or fulfill some long-term plan, others become liches because they fear death or to fulfill some malevolent purpose, such as long-sworn revenge. Regardless, the result is permanent and carries with it the potential to alter history-both that of those who transform themselves and of the countless mortals that will inevitably suffer as a result of a lich's new power.</p>\n<p>After its metamorphosis, a lich often finds some quiet place to dwell, typically protected by a variety of guardians and traps, for two primary purposes. First, a lich requires solitude in order to plan its elaborate schemes, and second, few mortals (if any) deign to interact with these legendarily corrupt necromancers. One reason begets the other, as the self-imposed isolation of a lich often drives the lich insane, further solidifying its separation from civilization. The longer a lich lives, the more meticulous a planner it becomes, secreting itself within a labyrinth of deadly puzzles, misdirection, and monsters. A lich's servants and guardians are absolutely loyal, either due to their nature (such as constructs or other undead) or as a result of compulsion using powerful magic. Many liches go mad, in time, and the nature of a lich's lair is a good indicator of the undead's current mental state.</p>\n<p>For all the protections it arrays around itself, a lich will go to greater lengths to guard its phylactery, as it knows that the destruction of this magical container spells doom for the lich. A lich is notoriously difficult to bargain with, though the threat of damaging its phylactery is a sure way to gain the upper hand in such a negotiation.</p>","source":{"value":"Pathfinder #191: The Destiny War"}},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":25},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":28},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":30}},"traits":{"languages":{"custom":"","selected":[],"value":["aklo","common","daemonic","draconic","mwangi","necril","osiriani","undercommon"]},"rarity":"unique","senses":{"value":"darkvision"},"size":{"value":"med"},"value":["undead"]},"schema":{"version":0.84,"lastMigration":null}},"type":"npc","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.stolen-fate-bestiary.25cRUcUTP3rK5qjU"}}}

You might need to attempt a Deception or Performance check to mimic the creature, as determined by the GM. This is especially likely if you're trying to imitate a specific person and engage with someone that person knows.</p>\n<p>In combat, the illusion can use 2 actions per turn, which it uses when you Sustain the Spell. It uses your spell attack roll for attack rolls and your spell DC for its AC. Its saving throw modifiers are equal to your spell DC - 10. It is substantial enough that it can flank other creatures. If the image is hit by an attack or fails a save, the spell ends.</p>\n<p>The illusion can cause damage by making the target believe the illusion's attacks are real, but it cannot otherwise directly affect the physical world. If the illusory creature hits with a Strike, the target takes mental damage equal to 1d4 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. This is a mental effect. The illusion's Strikes are nonlethal. If the damage doesn't correspond to the image of the monster-for example, if an illusory Large dragon deals only 5 damage-the GM might allow the target to attempt an immediate Perception check to disbelieve the spell. Any relevant resistances and weaknesses apply if the target thinks they do, as judged by the GM. For example, if the illusion wields a warhammer and attacks a creature resistant to bludgeoning damage, the creature would take less mental damage. However, illusory damage does not deactivate regeneration or trigger other effects that require a certain damage type. The GM should track illusory damage dealt by the illusion.</p>\n<p>Any creature that touches the image or uses the Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion. When a creature disbelieves the illusion, it recovers from half the damage it had taken from it (if any) and doesn't take any further damage from it.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The damage of the image's Strikes increases by 1d4, and the maximum size of creature you can create increases by one (to a maximum of Gargantuan).</p>"},"duration":{"value":"sustained"},"hasCounteractCheck":{"value":false},"level":{"value":2},"location":{"heightenedLevel":8,"uses":{"max":2,"value":2},"value":"LPsC4aPQJcVgNEdo"},"materials":{"value":""},"prepared":{"value":""},"primarycheck":{"value":""},"range":{"value":"500 feet"},"rules":[],"save":{"basic":"","value":""},"school":{"value":"illusion"},"secondarycasters":{"value":""},"secondarycheck":{"value":""},"slug":"illusory-creature","source":{"value":"Pathfinder Core Rulebook"},"spellType":{"value":"utility"},"sustained":{"value":false},"target":{"value":""},"time":{"value":"2"},"traditions":{"value":["arcane","occult"]},"traits":{"rarity":"common","value":["auditory","olfactory","visual"]},"schema":{"version":0.84,"lastMigration":null}},"type":"spell"},{"_id":"c4PlDRnDzFSJBxyw","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.QnTtGCAvdWRU4spv"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/detect-alignment.webp","name":"Detect Alignment (Constant)","sort":2100000,"system":{"ability":{"value":""},"area":{"type":"emanation","value":30},"category":{"value":"spell"},"components":{"focus":false,"material":false,"somatic":true,"verbal":true},"cost":{"value":""},"damage":{"value":{}},"description":{"value":"<p>Your eyes glow as you sense aligned auras.

Several troops might gather into a larger society with a council of troop leaders under one dominant elder.

Harpies can eat most creatures but strongly prefer sapient prey-humans and elves are their favorite. Although harpies will eat goblins if sufficiently hungry, they dislike their flavor and avoid eating them if possible. This doesn't comfort goblins, of course, who have a particularly strong fear of harpies. Because their aeries often reek with the gore of their kills and careless spatters of guano, harpies carry a distinctly vile scent that canny travelers associate with danger.

While some versions of this ritual offer all of the forms, others include only a single form or only a few of them. Whichever form you use, the effect can't be counteracted, though it can be ended by <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.4ddJSjC9Zz5DX0oG]</em>. Some forms of <em>imprisonment</em> can be ended by other means. Because the ritual requires the target to remain within 10 feet at all times, it typically requires you to subdue the target first.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Chains</strong> You bind the creature with chains, rendering it unable to use any actions other than to speak. Other creatures that attempt to approach, harm the chains, or free the trapped creature in any way must succeed at a Will save or be unable to do so forever. The chains have Hardness equal to 5 × the <em>imprisonment</em> ritual's spell level, and double that many Hit Points. Destroying the chains frees the target.</li>\n<li><strong>Object (9th level or higher)</strong> You either shrink the creature to an inch in height or transform it into an insubstantial form whose body trails away into wisps below its head. Either way, you trap it inside a gem, jar, bottle, lamp, or similar container. The creature ceases aging and doesn't require food or drink. The creature is still aware of its surroundings and can move within the container and speak, but it can't use any other actions. Destroying the container kills the target rather than freeing it. This form of <em>imprisonment</em> is also transmutation magic.</li>\n<li><strong>Oubliette (10th level only)</strong> You entomb the target in a state of suspended animation deep beneath the surface of the ground and out of tune with reality so that it can't be reached by any means. You also prevent divinations from revealing the location where the <em>imprisonment</em> occurred. Powerful magic such as <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.6dDtGIUerazSHIOu]</em> can reveal the location of the imprisonment, but even such magic can't free the target from the oubliette; only a 10th-level <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.4ddJSjC9Zz5DX0oG]</em> ritual can do so.</li>\n<li><strong>Prison</strong> You render the creature completely unable to leave a particular confined area or structure of your choice, such as a jail cell or sealed cave. The magic also prevents the creature from damaging its prison, either directly or indirectly, to break free. If the creature's prison is entirely destroyed by some external force, the creature is freed, though for some larger or natural prisons, this might be unfeasible.</li>\n<li><strong>Slumber (sleep effect)</strong> You put the creature into an eternal sleep. It ceases aging and doesn't require food or drink. A single sincere physical display of affection from a creature who genuinely loves the target-whether romantically, filially, or otherwise-frees it from the slumber. This form of <em>imprisonment</em> is also enchantment magic.</li>\n<li><strong>Temporal Stasis</strong> You send the creature into a state of suspended animation outside the flow of time. The creature doesn't grow older and can't be affected by any effect from within the normal timestream. While casting this ritual, you can optionally name any amount of time for the stasis; after this duration elapses, the stasis ends. Unlike other forms of <em>imprisonment</em>, temporal stasis can be counteracted by a <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.9HpwDN4MYQJnW0LG]</em> or <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.o6YCGx4lycsYpww4]</em> spell.

A Harrowing Vision takes an hour to perform, but most of that time consists of Hajeck and her chosen subject meditating and clearing their minds in a secluded area, culminating in an intense harrow reading that itself takes only a few minutes to complete. The target of a Harrowing Vision must remain adjacent to Hajeck for the entire hour, after which Hajeck shuffles her harrow deck and lays out seven cards, face down—one in the center (the future), two to either side (the present), and four more at the top, bottom, left, and right surrounding the central three (the past).</p>\n<p>When the harrowing takes place, the target flips over the four cards from the past, followed by the two present cards, and then finally the central card. This method of harrowing symbolizes how the choices a person made in their past often present them with an either/or decision in the now, and that their decision on that subject will lock in a future result. When All-Seeing Hajeck performs this reading for a PC, try to interpret the four cards from the past as representing events from that character's history—be it their background or references to events that took place during the Stolen Fate Adventure Path. For the two cards representing the present, try to interpret them as symbols of questions, events, or mysteries the PC is currently facing.</p>\n<p>Only the card representing the future has an actual game effect. When this central, final card is revealed, all of the PCs' potential futures suddenly flash in their mind in an overwhelming, chaotic vision. The PC must attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:32] save (note that as a PC grows more powerful and their Will save increases, they're more likely to achieve a better result from a Harrowing Vision, since they're that much closer to their ultimate destiny and are bolstered by the weight of their previous choices and decisions). If the suit of the card revealed for the PCs' future matches the PC's key ability from their class, they gain a +1 status bonus on this Will save. If the alignment of the card revealed matches the PC's alignment, they gain a +2 status bonus to this will save. If both match, these bonuses stack to a +3 status bonus, and the actual result of the save is improved by one degree of success. If neither the suit or alignment match the PC, they reduce the actual result of the save by one degree of success. Regardless of the result, that character cannot receive another Harrowing Vision until they gain a level, at which point any lingering effects from the Harrowing Vision end.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The character experiences a vision of a specific future success, only to forget it an instant later. Once only as long as this effect persists when the character is affected by a critical failure for any roll they make or a critical success with any roll a foe makes, the character can change that roll into a Success or a Failure, as they see fit. In addition, the character gains the</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> benefit detailed below.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The character experiences several overlapping potential successes in their future. As long as this effect persists (typically until the character gains a level), the maximum size of their hand for investing cards from the Deck of Destiny increases by 1 to six cards.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The vision is confusing and frightening, but has no lasting effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> Not only is the vision confusing and frightening, but the character becomes obsessed with worst-case scenarios, becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.3uh1r86TzbQvosxv]{Doomed 1}, and becomes cursed—they can no longer gain the benefit of their best possible futures.
